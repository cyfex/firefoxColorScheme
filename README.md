# Firefox Color Scheme Switch

A very easy to use firefox color scheme switch, with 4 dark theme builtin, very helpful for intensive readers to relief their sore eyes.

To run it, execute color_scheme.py. For first time running, you need to enter your profile ID, which can be found through Menu->Help->Troubleshooting Information->Profile Directory. For example, if your Profile Directory is "/home/john_doe/.mozilla/firefox/abcdefgh.default", your profile ID is "abcdefgh" (without parentheses).

It is shipped with four color schemes defined by me. You can also make your own color scheme. To do so, you just need to create a folder named by your color scheme and put user.js and userContent.css into it accordingly. The content of user.js and userContent.css should be very intuitive.

Have fun. Cheers~
